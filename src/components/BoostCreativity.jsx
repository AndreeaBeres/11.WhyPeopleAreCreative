      <h2>How to Boost Creativity</h2>
      <p>
        Whether you are a musician, designer, writer, dancer, filmmaker or any other kind of fine arts and production lover, you probably know the importance of creativity. Creativity 
        is part of what makes the work of artists special.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unique ideas are highly regarded in the artistic community. However, creativity does not always come easily. Mental blocks can make it feel impossible to come up with original 
        ideas or start a new project. Fortunately, there are ways to become mentally unstuck and get back to doing what you love.

      <b>Tips:</b>

          <h2>1. Commit Yourself to Creativity</h2>
          <p>
            The first step to increasing creativity is to devote yourself to developing your creative abilities. Do not put off your efforts. Set goals, enlist the help of others, and put 
            aside time each day to develop your skills. For example, if you are interested in painting, schedule time regularly to learn and practice your skills.

          <h2>2. Discover Quality in Quantity</h2>
          <p>
            Creativity is not about perfection. This means you do not have to worry about making every single idea amazing. Rather, consider coming up with many ideas, even if they do 
            not necessarily seem perfect or even good at first. These ideas can be steppingstones to other ideas that may come along.
          </p>
        </li>

          <h2>3. Build Your Confidence</h2>
          <p>
            Insecurity in your abilities can suppress creativity, which is why it is important to build confidence. Note your progress, commend your efforts, and always be on the lookout 
            for ways to reward your creativity.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>4. Look to the Ordinary</h2>
          <p>
            Look to ordinary, everyday things for inspiration. This can train your brain to think creatively. For example, if you see an interesting design or texture in the flooring at 
            the grocery store, take note so you can expand on your ideas and the concept later.
          </p>
        </li>

          <h2>5. Take Risks to Build Creativity</h2>
          <p>
            When it comes to building your creative skills, you must be willing to take risks to advance your abilities. Although your efforts may not lead to success every time, 
            you will still be boosting your creative talents and building skills that will serve you well in the future.

          <h2>6. Brainstorm New Ideas</h2>
          <p>
            Brainstorming is a common technique in both academic and professional settings, but it can also be a powerful tool for increasing creativity.
