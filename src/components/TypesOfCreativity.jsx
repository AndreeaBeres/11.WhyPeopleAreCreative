        <ul>
          <li><b>1. Scientific creativity is essential for breakthroughs and innovations. It's not just about coming up with new ideas but also about applying knowledge in novel ways 
            to solve complex problems.</b></li>
          <li><b>2. While some people may have a natural flair for creativity, scientific creativity is not limited to a select few. It's a skill that can be nurtured through practice,
