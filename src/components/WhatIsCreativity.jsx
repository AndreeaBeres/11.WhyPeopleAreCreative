      <h2>What is Creativity?</h2>
      <p>
        Creativity is the ability to think outside the box, to approach problems, ideas, or challenges in new and innovative ways. It's not confined to artists or writers; 
        it's a universal skill that spans across every field, from technology and science to business and education. Creativity is what drives progress and helps us discover new 
        possibilities.

        At its core, creativity is about connecting seemingly unrelated ideas, embracing curiosity, and daring to experiment. It's the spark that pushes boundaries, allows us to 
        see the world from different angles, and opens up endless opportunities for growth and invention.
